            Herein is the About Page. <br>
            This is my first HTML App page built by me. I am learning how to create web pages using HTML, CSS in VSC, etc
            combined with git bash and GitHub commands. <br>
            This is being typed manually and auto using Shift key + 1 + Enter from the VSC 
            with git-bash terminal command to stage, add, commit, push and status, then pull. <br> <br>
            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the standard language for creating web pages. <br>
            I am excited to learn more about HTML, CSS, product design and web development!<br> <br>
            Here, you can find information about my projects, skills, and contact details. <br>
